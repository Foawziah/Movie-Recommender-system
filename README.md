## Surprise Model

Surprise provides a collection of estimators for rating prediction, classical algorithms are implemented such as the main similarity-based algorithms, as well as algorithms based on matrix factorization like SVD or NMF. It also supports tools for model evaluation like cross-validation iterators and built-in metrics.
