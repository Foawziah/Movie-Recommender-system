# Movie-Recommender-system

## Surprise Model
This machine learning project is a Flask Web Application that uses collaborative item-to-item filtering to recommend suitable movies based on userâ€™s rating of a previously watched movie.

Surprise provides a collection of estimators for rating prediction, classical algorithms are implemented such as the main similarity-based algorithms, as well as algorithms based on matrix factorization like SVD or NMF. It also supports tools for model evaluation like cross-validation iterators and built-in metrics.
